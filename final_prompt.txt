You are a senior frontend engineer. Create a complete Personal Health & Fitness Tracking Dashboard React application and start the development server immediately.

## Role & Objective

You are an expert React frontend engineer. Your task is to generate a fully functional Personal Health & Fitness Tracking Dashboard web application, deploy all necessary files to the current working directory, install dependencies, start the development server, and open the application in a browser. All actions must be completed in this single interaction.

## Real-World Use Case

Build a Personal Health & Fitness Tracking Dashboard for daily health and exercise tracking. Users should be able to record daily activity metrics (steps, workout duration, heart rate) and review summaries and trends to better understand their physical activity patterns.

## Functional Requirements - Implement All 5 Features

1. **Add a Daily Health Record**
   - Create a form to add new daily records with: date, step count, workout duration (minutes), and average heart rate
   - Include form validation and error handling
   - Save records to application state

2. **Edit an Existing Health Record**
   - Implement edit functionality for any existing record
   - Pre-populate form fields with current values
   - Allow modification of steps, workout duration, and heart rate
   - Save changes and update the records list

3. **Delete a Health Record**
   - Provide delete button for each record
   - Include confirmation dialog before deletion
   - Remove record from the list upon confirmation

4. **View Health Records List**
   - Display all recorded health data in chronological order
   - Use a clean table or list format
   - Show date, steps, workout duration, and heart rate for each record
   - Make the list responsive for mobile devices

5. **Display Health Summary Dashboard**
   - Calculate and display total steps across all records
   - Calculate and display total workout duration
   - Calculate and display average heart rate
   - Include visual indicators: progress bars, charts, or badges
   - Show health insights or status messages

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack

- Visual effects (shadows, transitions, hover states)

## Project Structure

Create the following file structure:

```
current-directory/
├── package.json (React dependencies)
├── public/
│   └── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── index.js (entry point)
│   ├── index.css (global styles)
│   ├── App.js (main component with state management)
│   ├── App.css (main app styles)
│   └── components/
│       ├── HealthRecordForm.js (add/edit form component)
│       ├── HealthRecordForm.css
│       ├── HealthRecordsList.js (records table/list)
│       ├── HealthRecordsList.css
│       ├── DashboardSummary.js (statistics and charts)
│       └── DashboardSummary.css
├── start.bat (Windows startup script)
├── README.md (comprehensive documentation)
└── .gitignore
```

## Step-by-Step Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Create Project Files
Generate all required files with complete, production-ready code:

1. **package.json**: Include all necessary React dependencies (react, react-dom, react-scripts)
2. **public/index.html**: HTML template with appropriate meta tags and title
3. **src/index.js**: React entry point mounting App component
4. **src/index.css**: Global styles and CSS reset
5. **src/App.js**: Main component with:
   - State management for health records array
   - State for form editing mode
   - Functions: handleAddRecord, handleEditRecord, handleDeleteRecord
   - Render all three child components
6. **src/App.css**: Main layout styles with detailed documentation
7. **src/components/HealthRecordForm.js**: Form component with validation
8. **src/components/HealthRecordForm.css**: Form styles
9. **src/components/HealthRecordsList.js**: Records display component
10. **src/components/HealthRecordsList.css**: List/table styles
11. **src/components/DashboardSummary.js**: Statistics dashboard
12. **src/components/DashboardSummary.css**: Dashboard styles with visual indicators
13. **.gitignore**: Standard React gitignore (node_modules, build, .env, etc.)

### Step 2: Create Windows Startup Script (start.bat)

Create a `start.bat` file that:
- Checks if Node.js and npm are installed
- Displays clear status messages
- Automatically runs `npm install` if node_modules doesn't exist
- Starts the development server with `npm start`
- Automatically opens the default browser to http://localhost:3000
- Handles errors gracefully with informative messages
- Ensures one-click startup with no manual configuration needed

### Step 3: Create Comprehensive README.md

Generate a README.md containing:

**Section 1: Project Overview**
- Application name and purpose
- Real-world use case description
- Key benefits for users

**Section 2: Features**
List all 5 features with:
- Feature name and description
- Implementation approach
- Technologies/techniques used

**Section 3: Installation & Running**
- Prerequisites (Node.js version requirement)
- Step-by-step instructions to run start.bat
- Expected output and browser URL
- Troubleshooting common issues

**Section 4: UI Design Documentation**
- Color palette with hex codes and usage
- Typography system (font families, sizes, weights)
- Spacing and layout principles
- Responsive design strategy
- Visual design rationale

**Section 5: Project Structure**
- Directory tree explanation
- Component architecture
- Data flow description

**Section 6: Technical Details**
- Dependencies list
- State management approach
- Future enhancement possibilities

### Step 4: Add Sample Data

Include 2-3 sample health records pre-populated in the initial state so users can immediately see all features working.

### Step 5: Install Dependencies and Start Server

After creating all files:
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
2. Wait for installation to complete
3. Execute `npm start` to start the development server
4. Set PORT environment variable to 3001 if port 3000 is occupied
5. Wait for compilation to complete
6. Automatically open the application in the browser
7. Verify the application loads successfully

## Output Specifications

## Constraints & Preferences

### Mandatory Constraints
- Must use React and JavaScript only (no TypeScript)
- Must work on Windows (start.bat compatibility)
- No external UI libraries (Material-UI, Bootstrap, etc.)
- All styles must be custom CSS
- Must be fully self-contained (no external API calls)
- Must include comprehensive CSS documentation comments

### Style Preferences

- Clear visual separation between sections

### Code Preferences
- Functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Inline documentation for complex logic
- Consistent code formatting
- Descriptive variable and function names
- Modular component structure

## Quality Gates & Verification

Before completing, verify:

1. **File Creation**: All 14+ required files exist in correct structure
2. **Code Completeness**: No placeholder comments like "add logic here"
3. **Dependencies**: package.json includes react, react-dom, react-scripts
4. **start.bat Functionality**: Script runs without errors
5. **Server Status**: npm start executes and server compiles successfully
6. **Browser Launch**: Application opens automatically in browser
7. **Feature Verification**: 
   - Can add a new health record
   - Can edit an existing record
   - Can delete a record with confirmation
   - Records list displays chronologically
   - Summary dashboard shows calculated statistics
8. **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to different screen sizes
9. **Visual Quality**: Green theme applied, professional appearance
10. **Documentation**: README.md is complete and clear

## Critical Success Factors

This task must be completed entirely in this single interaction. The final state must include:
- All source code files created and populated
- Dependencies installed (node_modules directory present)
- Development server running and accessible
- Browser displaying the functional application
- All 5 features working correctly
- No manual intervention required from user

Do not ask for clarification or confirmation. Execute all steps automatically and report completion status with the application URL.

Execute the complete implementation now: create all files, install dependencies, start the server, and open the browser.
