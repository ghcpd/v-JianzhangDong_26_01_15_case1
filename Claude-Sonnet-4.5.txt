2. Functional Requirements: Implement the following 5 features:
   (1) Add a Daily Health Record
       Add a new daily record with date, step count, workout duration (minutes), and average heart rate.
   (2) Edit an Existing Health Record
       Modify an existing record’s details, including steps, workout duration, and heart rate.
   (3) Delete a Health Record
       Remove an existing daily health record from the list.
   (4) View Health Records List
       Display all recorded health data in a chronological list or table format.
   (5) Display Health Summary Dashboard
       Show a summary dashboard with total steps, total workout duration, and average heart rate, including simple visual indicators or charts.

3. Technical Requirements:
   - Programming language: JavaScript (React)
   - Page style: Health & Wellness Dashboard
   - Layout should be clean and visually appealing, with an overall color tone of green.
   - UI should be aesthetically pleasing, well-aligned, responsive, with clear visual hierarchy.
   - Include comments or documentation about fonts, colors, spacing, and layout for easier UI aesthetics evaluation.

4. Startup Script:
   - Generate a `start.bat` file that can start the project on Windows with a single click or command and automatically open the default browser to view the page.
   - Ensure the startup process is simple, with no hidden dependencies or complex configuration.

5. Documentation:
   - Generate a `README.md` file containing:
     - Project overview and real-world use case.
     - List of features and explanation of how each feature is implemented.
     - Instructions on how to run `start.bat` to view the UI.
     - Any dependency installation or environment requirements (if applicable).
   - Documentation should be clear and easy to follow so anyone can replicate the setup.

6. Additional Requirements:
   - Code should be clean, with intuitive naming and complete comments.
   - UI output and test logs should be self-explanatory.
   - Use a clear project structure.

I can see the script has checked Node.js and npm successfully. It appears the terminal output isn't showing the full installation progress yet. Let me check if node_modules needs to be installed first, and then manually start the development server. 

Ran terminal command: if (!(Test-Path "node_modules")) { npm install } else { Write-Host "[INFO] Dependencies already installed." }; npm start

Ran terminal command: npm install
